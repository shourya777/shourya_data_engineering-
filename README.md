# 🌍 News Scraper Project

This project is a simple Python-based tool that scrapes real-time news articles from Google News based on custom keywords. It was created as part of my ongoing data engineering learning journey to practice web scraping, automation, and data handling.

## 🔧 What This Project Does

- Takes a list of keywords (e.g. “earthquake”, “flood”, “supply chain disruption”)
- Scrapes related headlines from Google News
- Cleans the results and saves them into a CSV file
- Can be reused to automate monitoring of news across specific topics or regions
